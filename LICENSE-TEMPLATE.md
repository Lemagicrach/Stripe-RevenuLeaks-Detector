# Template License (RevPilot Starter Kit)

This license applies to the **template/starter-kit** version of this project when sold as a digital product.

## What you may do (Buyer Permissions)
- Use the code to build **unlimited** personal or commercial projects.
- Modify, rebrand, and deploy your own derivative product(s).
- Use the template for client work (including white-label implementations).

## What you may NOT do (Restrictions)
- **Resell, repackage, or redistribute** the template “as-is” (or with only minor cosmetic changes).
- Publish the template (or large parts of it) as an open-source project or public repository.
- Sell access to the source code as a competing “starter kit”, “boilerplate”, or “template” product.

## Support
- The seller may optionally provide limited support (e.g., email/Discord) as described at purchase time.
- No warranty is provided unless explicitly stated.

## Attribution
- Attribution is not required, but appreciated.

## Enforcement
If you violate this license, your rights to use the template terminate automatically.

If you want a dual-license setup (Open Source core + Paid template license), add a standard OSS license (MIT/Apache-2.0) for the core and keep this license for premium modules.
